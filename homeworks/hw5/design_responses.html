                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> One thing I took away from this article is the importance of movement and interactivity in design. All of the interactions shown in the article are engaging and rewarding for the user because of the visual feedback that is both aesthetically pleasing and conveys some message. Static interfaces wouldn't be able to retain as much interest and desire to continue using the interface. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Because of the work and the articles I've already done in this class, I really noticed the typography and color choices in the designs. I think its super interesting how all these components come together to catch someones eye and make the experience more enjoyable for the user. I liked that I could look at the different designs and understand the choices they made to cater specifically to their different products </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I really enjoyed the easygrow.io app's design. The interface is very user-friendly and I'm very drawn to the color palette they've chosen. I think the vibrant, sunny colors perfectly align with their product and their audience. The transitions and animations are also beautiful, but don't distract from the purpose of the app, which is to provide information on gardening. </p>

                            <p>8! It's interesting to see different approaches to design and to apply my knowledge to the various inspirations! </p>
