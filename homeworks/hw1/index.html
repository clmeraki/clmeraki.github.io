<p>Hi, my name is Chloe, and I'm currently pursuing a career in UI/UX design. I'm from Lake Forest, California, about a 6.5 hour drive south of Berkeley. In my free time, I love to figure skate, play video games, and paint. I'm also a budding tattoo artist! </p>
<p>Here are some of my favorite places to eat in Berkeley:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Butcher's Son</li>
    <li>Imm Thai</li>
    <li>Noodle Dynasty</li>
</ul>

    <li>Through this article, I learned that three components to keep an eye out for when studying deisgn are hierarchy, content, intent, and audience. Considering all of these aspects allows for the most effective and appropriate design choices. </li>
    <li>My favorite part of this article was the specific examples it provided when explaining how you can study design in apps you use in your everyday life. They gave specific observations on the Air Bnb, Twitter, and Spotify apps. </li>
    <li>"By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</li>
    <li>I would give this article a 6. Though I felt it somewhat lacked depth, it provided information in a succinct and approachable manner, which I appreciated.</li>
