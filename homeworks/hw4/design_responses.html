					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article highlights a design component that I often overlook when thinking about accessibility. Making sure you have enough contrast between the colors you're choosing could help your audience differentiate between elements on your website and have a more positive user experience overall. The term focus state contrast was also new to me. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is where it emphasizes not relying on color to be the sole communicator of information. For someone who has no visual impairments, something like a border changing colors to red might be enough to indicate an error state. However, those with visual impairments or color deficiencies may not even notice a change. That is why it is super important to include secondary means of communication, such as an icon or a written notice. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Thought this was a smart idea! "When displaying things like graphs or charts, giving users the option to add texture or patterns ensures that those who are colorblind can distinguish between them without having to worry about color affecting their perception of the data." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
