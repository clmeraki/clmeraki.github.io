							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article goes over the importance of typography. It is a far more complex and important element of design than I previously realized. Readability, legibility, and purpose are three important principles to consider when choosing type. Though a flashy and decorative font can be used sparingly for aesthetic purposes, fonts that are conventional and easy to read are far superior when the purpose of the text is to convey information. No more than 3 different fonts should be paired together. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I most enjoyed the section about choosing the font that best suits your intended audience. It never occured to me that different demographics would have different tastes in fonts, as well as different ability to digest different fonts. Children, for example, would gravitate more and have more accessibility to fonts that are bold and simple. I also like the section about font sizing and finding the perfect ratio, so one section does not overwhelm the others. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Typography is all about experimentation. Itâ€™s both a science and an art." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
